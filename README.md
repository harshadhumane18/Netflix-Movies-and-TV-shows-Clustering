## Project Overview
This project utilizes a dataset consisting of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset, collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine, reveals that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010, while the number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles. This project aims to explore insights from this dataset and integrate it with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes for more interesting findings.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
2. Understand what type of content is available in different countries.
3. Determine if Netflix has increasingly focused on TV rather than movies in recent years.
4. Cluster similar content by matching text-based features.
5. Provide recommendations based on the analysis.

## Machine Learning Project Approach
The general approach for this machine learning project will be as follows:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources and combine them into a single, coherent dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the distribution and correlation of variables, identify patterns and trends in the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing ones to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.
5. **Model Building**: Build a clustering model to group similar content together.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.
7. **Recommendation Generation**: Use the model to generate recommendations.

## Conclusion
Netflix's content analysis reveals a shift towards prioritizing TV shows over movies in recent years. While movie growth initially outpaced TV shows, 2017 marked a peak in movie releases, followed by a decline and a surge in TV show releases post-2017. Release patterns concentrate towards year-end. International Movies/TV Shows lead genres, and the United States is the primary content producer. Prolific directors like Jan Sulter and Raul Campos contribute significantly, with Indian actors dominating. TV-MA is a popular rating, and movies typically fall within the 80 to 120-minute duration. Most TV shows follow a single-season format, except for long-running exceptions like Grey's Anatomy. Cluster analysis identified 12 content clusters, and PCA revealed that 95% of the variance is explained by 5000 components, offering valuable insights.
